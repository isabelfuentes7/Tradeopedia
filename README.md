## Functionality

This is where we discuss how to use the software/app/etc. For example, for our project 'MeDo':

- Currently, No Installation necessary. Simply navigate to [the Medo webpage](https://mpaitgt.github.io/Medo-frontend/) to begin using.
- Google Chrome is our recommended web browser, but your preferred browser will work as well.
- User can input an artist/movie's name and add them to their respective list
- A list item will display the following:
  - The tile of the artist/band
  - The amount of time that has passed since the item was first added
  - A like button
  - A removed button
